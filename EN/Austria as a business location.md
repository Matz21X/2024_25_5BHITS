# Austria as a business location
#EN Matthias Hrbek

For many reasons Austria is an attractive business location. One of its main advantages is its reliable public transport. Within cities such as Vienna there are well-developed networks of buses, trams and trains that contribute to efficient commuting and accessibility. Another point is that Austria is known for its city safety. Residents and business professionals can enjoy life with a feeling of security provided by low crime rates and protected surroundings. Also to its credit are good recreational facilities in the country. With sports, hiking, cultural activities, you can find all kinds of leisure activities here that help to balance work and family life very well.

It may come as a surprise to discover that housing costs in many parts of Austria are relatively low compared with those in other European cities, making it feasible for employees to live not far from where they work. Furthermore, the infrastructure is excellent, with top-notch roads, modern airports, and advanced communication networks supporting business operations.

Austria also prides itself on a highly trained workforce. Its educational system stresses vocational training: this ensures that enterprises have workers with the necessary professional skills in every sector to perform. So when it comes to international trade, Austria benefits as well from being a member of the eurozone.

In the end, low levels of corruption mean that business is conducted fairly and openly in Austria. This creates trust and reliability, making Austria a wonderful place to invest and establish your business.
