**Types of power units:**
- Internal combustion engine (First was the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886)
- Electric Motors (Earliest ones in 1888, Mass production in 1996 with the GM EV1)
- Hybrid-Systems (Internal combustion engines and electric motors in one powertrain)
- Fuel-Cells / Hydrogen (First was the Toyota Mirai in 2014)

### Combustion engines:

- I4, I5, I6, I10, V6, V8, V10, V12, ...
- Difference in fuel systems (Gasoline, Diesel)
- Forced induction (Difference between Turbochargers and Superchargers)

### Fuel cell technology

- FCVs use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which powers an electric motor.
- The fuel cell combines **hydrogen (H₂) with oxygen (O₂)** from the air in an electrochemical reaction, producing electricity, **water (H₂O) as the only emission**, and heat.
  
- **Zero Emissions**: Only water vapor is emitted, making them environmentally friendly.
- **Fast Refueling**: Takes about **3-5 minutes**, much faster than charging a BEV.
- **Long Range**: Typically **500–800 km (310–500 miles)** per tank, similar to gasoline cars.
- **Lightweight Fuel**: Hydrogen is much lighter than batteries, helping FCVs maintain efficiency.
  
- **Limited Infrastructure**: Few hydrogen refueling stations, mainly in regions like California, Japan, and parts of Europe.
- **Hydrogen Production**: Most hydrogen today comes from fossil fuels (**gray hydrogen**), which produces CO₂. **Green hydrogen** (from renewable energy) is still expensive.
- **High Cost**: Fuel cells and hydrogen production are costly compared to battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.
  

### Smart cars

- Todays cars are already kitted out with self-driving features such as Teslas, BYDs and many more.
- Most cars are already interconnected.

# Biohacking

 **1. About Biohacking?**
- Biohacking is the practice of **optimizing the body and mind** using science, technology, and self-experimentation.
- It ranges from **simple lifestyle changes** (like diet and sleep tracking) to **advanced interventions** (such as implanting technology or gene editing).
- The goal is often to **enhance performance, longevity, and overall well-being**.

 **2. Types of Biohacking**
- **Nutritional Biohacking**: Adjusting diet (e.g., ketogenic diet, fasting, supplements) for better energy and health.
- **DIY Biology**: Experimenting with biology outside traditional labs, sometimes including genetic modifications (e.g., CRISPR).
- **Grinder Biohacking**: Implanting technology (RFID chips, magnets, or sensors) into the body.
- **Neurohacking**: Using brain stimulation (nootropics, meditation, or neurofeedback) to improve cognitive function.
- **Wearable Tech**: Using smart devices (like Oura rings, glucose monitors) to track and optimize body functions.

 **3. Benefits of Biohacking**
- Improved **focus, energy, and cognitive function**.
- Enhanced **physical performance and longevity**.
- Better **sleep, metabolism, and immune system regulation**.
- Increased **self-awareness** through data tracking (blood tests, heart rate monitoring, etc.).

 **4. Risks & Controversies**
- **Lack of regulation**: Some biohacks lack scientific validation and could be risky.
- **Ethical concerns**: Genetic modifications and implanted tech raise moral questions.
- **Potential health risks**: DIY experiments can lead to unintended side effects.
- **Addiction to optimization**: Constant tracking and tweaking may lead to anxiety.

 **5. Notable Biohackers & Trends**
- **Dave Asprey**: Founder of the "Bulletproof" movement, known for biohacking with coffee, supplements, and fasting.
- **Bryan Johnson**: Tech entrepreneur spending millions on age-reversing biohacks.
- **DIY Gene Editing**: Some biohackers experiment with CRISPR on themselves, though it’s highly controversial.
- **Smart Drugs & Nootropics**: Supplements like **L-theanine, caffeine, modafinil** are popular for cognitive enhancement.
