**Types of power units:**
- Internal combustion engine (First was the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886)
- Electric Motors (Earliest ones in 1888, Mass production in 1996 with the GM EV1)
- Hybrid-Systems (Internal combustion engines and electric motors in one powertrain)
- Fuel-Cells / Hydrogen (First was the Toyota Mirai in 2014)

### Combustion engines:

- I4, I5, I6, I10, V6, V8, V10, V12, ...
- Difference in fuel systems (Gasoline, Diesel)
- Forced induction (Difference between Turbochargers and Superchargers)

### Fuel cell technology

- FCVs use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which powers an electric motor.
- The fuel cell combines **hydrogen (H₂) with oxygen (O₂)** from the air in an electrochemical reaction, producing electricity, **water (H₂O) as the only emission**, and heat.
  
- **Zero Emissions**: Only water vapor is emitted, making them environmentally friendly.
- **Fast Refueling**: Takes about **3-5 minutes**, much faster than charging a BEV.
- **Long Range**: Typically **500–800 km (310–500 miles)** per tank, similar to gasoline cars.
- **Lightweight Fuel**: Hydrogen is much lighter than batteries, helping FCVs maintain efficiency.
  
- **Limited Infrastructure**: Few hydrogen refueling stations, mainly in regions like California, Japan, and parts of Europe.
- **Hydrogen Production**: Most hydrogen today comes from fossil fuels (**gray hydrogen**), which produces CO₂. **Green hydrogen** (from renewable energy) is still expensive.
- **High Cost**: Fuel cells and hydrogen production are costly compared to battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.
  

### Smart cars

- Todays cars are already kitted out with self-driving features such as Teslas, BYDs and many more.
- Most cars are already interconnected.
