The unequal society (the original idea of the American Dream, the concept in the 1950ies; factors that make it harder to achieve it today; food deserts; poverty cycle; childhood poverty)  
# The Unequal Society  
## The Original Idea of the American Dream  
The **American Dream** was the belief that anyone, regardless of background, could achieve **prosperity** and success through hard work and **determination**. In the **1950s**, this idea was **embodied** by:  
- **Economic growth**: A booming post-war economy with well-paying jobs.  
- **Homeownership**: Government programs made buying a house **attainable**.  
- **Upward mobility**: Education and hard work led to a better life than one’s parents.

However, this dream was **inaccessible** to many minorities due to **systemic** racism (e.g., redlining, segregation).  
## Factors That Make It Harder to Achieve Today  
Several **barriers** now make the American Dream more **elusive**:  
- **Income inequality**: The wealth gap between the rich and poor has **widened**.  
- **Rising costs**: Housing, education, and healthcare are **prohibitively** expensive.  
- **Job insecurity**: Automation and gig work reduce stable employment.  
- **Student debt**: Limits financial mobility for young adults.  
- **Discrimination**: Systemic biases in hiring, wages, and lending persist.  
## Food Deserts  
**Food deserts** are areas with limited access to affordable, nutritious food, often in low-income or minority neighbourhoods.  
- Causes: Supermarkets avoid these areas; fast food is more **accessible**.  
- Effects: Higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and **malnutrition**.  
- Solutions: Urban farming, incentives for grocery stores, better public transport.  
## Poverty Cycle  
The **poverty cycle** is a self-reinforcing loop where economic hardship is passed between generations.  
- **Low education** → Few job opportunities → **Low wages** → Poor living conditions → Children struggle in school → Repeat.  
- Breaking the cycle requires **interventions** like better schools, job training, and social programs.  
## Childhood Poverty  
Children in poverty face **long-term disadvantages**:  
- **Health**: Poor nutrition leads to developmental issues.  
- **Education**: Underfunded schools, lack of resources.  
- **Psychological stress**: Instability affects mental health.  
- **Future prospects**: Higher likelihood of remaining in poverty as adults.
